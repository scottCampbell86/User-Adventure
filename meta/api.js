      All the way from Lowell, you made it to NYC!
      You're a student and a standout on the gridiron in Columbia, not bad for kid from Mill-City.
      But tonight you stumbled into a haunt on 9th and 3rd and met a cool, cool cat named Ginsberg, he was reading some poem he was writing, Howl.
      What do you think? Call it a night, get some rest for the game tomorrow, or see what Ginsberg and his crew have planned for the evening?
